📚 Data Structures Applications in C

This repository contains implementations of Data Structures and their real-world applications using the C programming language.
The programs focus on stack operations and demonstrate practical use-cases like expression conversions, evaluation, palindrome checks, and binary conversion.

📂 Repository Structure

stack_integer_implementation.c → Basic stack implementation (push, pop, display)
infix_to_postfix.c → Convert infix expression to postfix using stack
infix_to_prefix.c → Convert infix expression to prefix using stack
postfix_evaluator.c → Evaluate postfix expressions
integer_to_binary_stack.c → Convert integers to binary using stack
palindrome_stack.c → Check if a string is palindrome using stack
parentheses_checker_stack.c → Validate balanced parentheses/brackets using stack
🚀 Features
